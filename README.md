## Using the [range slider with Dragging interval](http://ionden.com/a/plugins/ion.rangeSlider/demo_advanced.html)

I'm trying to use the drgaggin interval which is shown in the last sample of the [advanced documentation page](http://ionden.com/a/plugins/ion.rangeSlider/demo_advanced.html)
Here, the slider is working fine.  I can also implement this sample in a (vanilla AngularJS)[] project, and all is good.

However, when using the same code in an Ionic app, the slider and styles are missing.

Here are the steps taken.
Install the package with Bower since it's a front end dependency:
```
$ bower i 
```

We put this in templates/tab-dash.html:
```
<input type="text" id="example_id" name="example_name" value="" />
```

Then we put this function in the controllers.js:
```
$("#example_id").ionRangeSlider({
    type: "double",
    min: 0,
    max: 10000000,
    from: 100000,
    to: 110000,
    drag_interval: true
});
```

Then include there:
```
	<link href="lib/ion.rangeSlider/css/ion.rangeSlider.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="lib/ion.rangeSlider/css/ion.rangeSlider.skinFlat.css" el="stylesheet"/>
```

Then we have to take care of this error:
```
ReferenceError: $ is not defined
```

by including these:
```
	<script type="text/javascript" src="lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="lib/ionic/js/ionic.bundle.js"></script>
    <script src="lib/ion.RangeSlider/js/ion.RangeSlider.js"></script>
```

However, the actual slider wonâ€™t show up in Ionic.
The same code works in a vanilla angular app, but not here.
This is the tag that is created to show the sliders.
```
<span class="irs-bar" style="cursor: ew-resize;left: 10%;width: 10%;"></span>

```
that part does not show anything.  Trying it without Ionic to see if that is the problem.
